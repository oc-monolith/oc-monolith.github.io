    <p>
      monolith is a monolithic kernel turned full-fledged operating system written in lua for the opencomputers minecraft mod.&nbsp;&nbsp;it supports cooperative mulittasking through use of lua's coroutines.

    <h2>installation</h2>
    <p>
      the monolith installer will run on both openos and monolith.&nbsp;&nbsp;you will need a hard disk with either operating system installed--note that both disks must be writable or installation will fail.
      <br><br>
      in the operating system's shell, type <span class="code">wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocawesome101/oc-monolith/master/installer.lua</span> and press the <span class="code">[enter]</span> key.&nbsp;&nbsp;once the file has downloaded, run <span class="code">./installer.lua</span> and follow the prompts.&nbsp;&nbsp;note that the installer will not let you install monolith to the tmpfs or the boot address, usually the currently mounted root filesystem.
